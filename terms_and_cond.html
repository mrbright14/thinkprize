                </h2>
                <p>
                 ThinkPrize users are expected to have fun and to be safe, and those expectations influence how we advertise on our site. Advertisers must be honest, thorough, and exact about the products or services their ads promote; they must avoid content that misleads or offends; and they must never compromise our users' privacy. These Advertising Policies apply to all ads on ThinkPrize.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Advertisers must comply with ThinkPrize Terms and Conditions and all other ThinkPrize policies governing the use of our services. We may update our terms, policies, and guidelines from time to time, so please check in and review them regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our user base includes teenagers (as young as 16), nonagenarians, and everyone in between. Advertisers are responsible for ensuring that their ads are suitable for ThinkPrize users that are considered minors in the United States. They're also responsible for ensuring that their ads comply with all applicable laws, industry codes, rules, and regulations in each geographic area where the ads will run.
                </p>

                <p>
                  ThinkPrize may share information related to ads with third parties, including: (a) our media partners when your ads run in content related to that media partner; and (b) third parties whose products or services you’ve elected to use in connection with the ads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our users may share ads with other ThinkPrize users or save ads to their devices. They may use any of the tools and features we make available in ThinkPrize to apply captions, drawings, filters, or other creative elements to the ad. Age-targeted ads can be shared within ThinkPrize with ThinkPrize users of any age. To find out if you can restrict ad sharing and ad saving for your ads within ThinkPrize, please contact your account representative at
