              ThinkPrize Privacy Policy
            </h2>
            <div class="terms-box">
              <div class="terms-content">
                <p>
                  ThinkPrize is a social media network, contest, advertising and instant messaging platform. Our brand represents fun opportunities, excitement, and global collaboration. When you use our platform, you’ll share some information with us. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, update, and delete your information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That’s why we’ve written this Privacy Policy.
                  And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the
                  legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about
                  anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us at   <a href="#"> admin@thinkprize.com. </a>
                </p>
                You should read our entire Privacy Policy, but when you only have a few minutes or want to remember something later on, you can always take a look at this summary—so you can review some of the basics in just a few minutes.
                <h2 class="">
                  Information We Collect
                </h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Information you choose to give us.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Information we get when you use our services.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Information we get from third parties.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  Information You Choose to Give Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                  When you interact on our platform we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a ThinkPrize user/Game Changer  account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username you’d like to go by, a password, an email address, and phone number. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through our platform, such as instant messaging and posting to your friends. Keep in mind that the users you send global post or instant messaging, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the website. So, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to ThinkPrize as well: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: When you communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer. Lastly, losing a contest can be embarrassing. ThinkPrize does not assume responsibility for any user actions or responses towards losing a contest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few messages friends.

                    <span class="bold">Usage Information.</span> We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:

                        How you interact with our services, such as which filters you view or apply to, which Stories you watch on Discover, whether you’re using Spectacles, or which search queries you submit.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        How you communicate with other ThinkPrize users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  <li>
                    If you ever decide to stop using ThinkPrize, you can just delete your account. We’ll also delete most of the information we’ve collected about you after you’ve been inactive for a while—but don’t worry, we’ll try to contact you first!

                  Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. There may be legal requirements to store your data and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content or if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.

                  Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called “legal bases” and, at ThinkPrize, we typically rely on one of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">  Contract.</span>
                   One reason we might use your information is because you’ve entered into an agreement with us.

                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">
                      Legitimate interest.
                    </span> Another reason we might use your information is because we have—or a third party has—a legitimate interest in doing so.

                    <span class="bold">Consent.</span> In some cases we’ll ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes. If we do, we’ll make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions. Even if we’re not relying on consent to use your information, we may ask you for permission to access data like contacts and location.

                  We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live. Whenever we share information of EU users outside the EU we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place. For internal transfers, we rely on Model Contractual Clauses or the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, which you can read more about here. You can find more information on the categories of third parties we share information with here.

                Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 18. And that’s why we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. In addition, we may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of EU users. In some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality to these users. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent before we collect and use that information.</p>

                  We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).
